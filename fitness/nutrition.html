                    <p>Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new
                        way of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses
                        food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel
                    </p>

                    <p>Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a
                        lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change you will see big 
                        results. The key to success is a daily focus on your goal
                    </p>

                    <p>Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free
                        mobile apps available to help track your activity level and 
                        calories
                    </p>

                    <p>Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow
                        yourself to one "cheat" meal a week
                    </p>

                    <h3> What to eat</h3>
                    <img src="images/fresh-food.jpg" alt="fresh vegetables, fruit, eggs and nuts" class="round">

                    <p> Use the Following as a guideline:</p>

                    <ul> 
                        <li>Protein, such as eggs, chicken, and lean red meat</li>
                        <li>Vegetables, but avoid corn and peas</li>
                        <li>Fruits</li>
                        <li>Fat, such as olive oil, nuts, and seeds</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Limit the consumption of bread, pasta, white potato, and processed food.
                        These foods are high in carbohydrates.
                    </p>

                    <p> When you shop for groceries, shop the outside aisles and buy
                        organic when possible. Stock up on fresh vegetables, almond flour, and flax seeds
